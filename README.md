# health_impairment
The project uses social determinants of health to predict the existence of a health impairment or condition of an individual in the US (e.g., a health condition includes but is not limited to diabetes, heart disease, or ADHD). This project will benefit federal, state, and local governments and agencies in determining an individual's health condition and deriving policies to address the condition or alleviate the effects of the impairment.

Data originates from the Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey (WBNS, ICPSR 37513). The survey collected data on social determinants of the health of nonelderly adults to monitor changes in individual and family well-being in the US.

The survey data includes information collected from randomly sampled adults across the US (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), ages 18 to 64. The survey covers various topics, including health insurance, housing, food, security, employment, family income, and financial security.

This notebook has a survey that allows a user to input information about a new participant (see User Input: New Data). The new data will be entered into the optimized model to predict whether the new participant has a health impairment/condition.
